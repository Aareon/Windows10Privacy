# Windows10Privacy
Windows 10 Privacy Utility streamlines many of Windows 10's built in privacy settings into something that is easy for people to access on a single page while also providing an easy way to access hidden functions and additional toolsets.

With this app you can:

  Set privacy settings with the push of a single button
  
  Fine tune privacy settings from a single page
  
  "Disable" Windows Telemetry (this doesn't stop everything, Microsoft worked pretty hard to make that impossible)
  
  
  Uninstall Windows 10 built in apps (many of which cannot be removed through windows)
  
  Remove provisioned applications (default applications that install for new users)
  
  
  
  Restore the old Windows 7 Photo Viewer (This uses a script from: https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/14312-restore-windows-photo-viewer-windows-10-a.html by Shawn Brink)
  
  Clear your start menu tiles with one button
  
  Reset the start menu tiles to default
  
  Disable and uninstall OneDrive
  
  Disable Edge Browser
  
  Set your explorer home screen ("This PC" vs "Quick Access")
  
  
Basically, this app was designed to make configuring Windows 10 after an install as easy as pushing a single button and waiting 5 minutes instead of having to navigate a hundred menus. 


It should go without saying, but if you use this app, you can seriously screw up your Windows install. Use it at your own risk.
